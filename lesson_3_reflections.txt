When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When a logically completed chunk of work is ready to share with others, it can be moved to remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. When working in collaboration, someone else can make changes on the remote repository, that I might not be interested in.
2. Only when I determine whether I want that change, only then will I pull those changes manually.
